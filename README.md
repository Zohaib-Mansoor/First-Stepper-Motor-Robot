This project includes the stepper motor and its module, along with a simple code that functions to get the stepper motor running and defines {motorspeed, size of the step, # of revolutions needed to spin a total of 360 degrees}
Also, I attached a long stick to the stepper motor top, but you can use other materials aswell (pencil, straw, wooden stick, plastic rod, glass rod). I then attached a paper puppet to the stepper motor.
